# Term-Project
For our project we developed the simulator 'Voyage'. It comprises 3 stages--takeoff, orbit, and landing--with particular focus being placed on the orbit stage. The takeoff and landing stages run on a low-altitude atmospheric physics engine (uses low-altitude gravitaional force simplifications, and takes account of drag force), while the orbital version uses a different one (n-body gravitational force computed between each discrete pair of objects); both are designed to be realistic and utilize differential equations to generate accurate models of physical systems. Key features include projections of future states (using a color gradient to represent parallel progression of time), a camera that can zoom in multiple times, pan (in the map mode), and track the rocket, and realistic n-body physics. All drawings were made in CMU graphics, but we did have to take screenshots of some of the drawings and rotate those due to computational limitations.
